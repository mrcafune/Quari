**Quari** is the successor to KittyChat, a CLI, API dependent frontend for ChatGPT.

**Quari** is an interactive Python application that integrates OpenAI's models to create a highly engaging, AI-driven conversation interface. The application allows users to engage in dynamic conversations with a virtual assistant, right from the comfort of their terminal.

Built with Python and using OpenAI's API, Quari delivers thoughtful and contextually relevant responses, offering a unique and exciting conversational experience.

## üîë Key Features

- **Interactive Conversations:** Engage in real-time, dynamic conversations with the virtual assistant
- **Color-coded Dialogue:** Messages are color-coded for a more visual and intuitive user experience. 
- **Session Management:** Start a new conversation or continue from a saved session. The application can store your conversation history for later reference.
- **Command Options:** Use various commands for improved interactivity and control over the application.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To use Quari, you will need to have an API key from OpenAI. On first-time setup, you will be prompted for your API key and desired model.

After starting the application, you can choose to start a new conversation or load a previous session. The application will guide you with the available commands and options by entering `-help`. During the conversation, type your message after the "Message:" prompt, and the virtual assistant will respond accordingly.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Commands

- `-exit`: Exit the conversation. You'll be prompted to save the conversation.
- `-alwaysask`: Always ask at startup whether to start a new conversation or load a previous one.
- `-neverask`: Never ask at startup, always start a new conversation.
- `-help`: Display the help message. (lol)
- `-model`: Change the AI Model.
- `-sessionsummary`: Prints the loaded session's previous conversation.
- `-reset`: Runs the first-time setup, allowing you to change the API key & model.
